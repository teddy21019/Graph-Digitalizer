- When click "set x axis"
    1. click first point
    1. an arrow from the first clicked point to current mouse position is set
    1. click second point
    1. two way ray is plot on the canvas
    1. assign the two values on the canvas by appearing a box on the side. first point default 0

- No need to set origin. But nice to still plot it.

- Image
    - scale
    - rotation
    - rotation and skewness correction can be done once axis is generated

- Make each datapoint a component as well
